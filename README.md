# medInventoryManager
An app that allows users to track the buying and selling of medicines to different local clinics. 

## Background
My aunt owns a small pharmacy. When she learned that I was learning web development, she asked me if I could make an app that could help her manage her work at the pharmacy, which was then done all by "brute force" (meaning papers, pens, calculations, and of course mis-calculations) ðŸ¤£. Of course I said yes! I took it as an opportunity to put my programming skills to test, and besides, I was not sure about what I should do for the final project of CS50.
